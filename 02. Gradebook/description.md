# Gradebook

This JavaScript program calculates the class average, assigns a grade to a student based on their score, and determines if the student passed or failed. It consists of the following logic:

- **`getAverage(scores)`**: Calculates the average score of all students.
- **`getGrade(score)`**: Assigns a grade based on the student's score.
- **`hasPassingGrade(score)`**: Determines if the student has a passing grade (not "F").
- **`studentMsg(totalScores, studentScore)`**: Generates a message that includes the class's average, the student's grade, and whether they passed or failed.

The code takes a list of scores and the student's score, then outputs a message detailing the class average, the student's grade, and pass/fail status.

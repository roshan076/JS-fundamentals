## Team Cards

This JavaScript code displays information about the Argentina football team from the 1986 World Cup, including details about the team, the sport, the head coach, and players. The data is stored in an object called `myFavoriteFootballTeam`, which is then displayed dynamically on a webpage.

### Features:
- The team's name, sport, and World Cup year are displayed.
- The head coach's name is shown.
- A dynamic player card section is generated based on the position or nickname of the players, filtered by the selected option in a dropdown list.

### Key Components:
1. **HTML Elements**: The code retrieves DOM elements like team name, sport, year, and player cards to update them dynamically.
2. **Player Cards**: The `setPlayerCards` function creates HTML cards for each player, displaying their name, position, number, and nickname.
3. **Event Listener**: The dropdown list filters the player cards based on criteria like position or players with nicknames when changed.
